- takes as input an EEG file that only contains time frames of the four TK maps
- computes EEG microstate modelmaps based on each time frame (not! GFP peaks only)
- retrieves, as expected an explained variance of 1 for all GFP peaks (which is in this case, all maps since the selection GFP_peaks = False considers all maps as GFP peaks) and an explained variance of 1 for all EEG time frames
